# No Title #

During my two week internship in the Competence Center for Scalable Data Services and Solutions Dresden/Leipzig ([ScaDS](http://scads.de)), I had the pleasure of delving head first into parallel computing.
Using the [rootbeer library](https://github.com/pcpratts/rootbeer1) for Java, I was able get a grasp on the concept of parallel computing, sorting algorithms (merge sort, odd-even sort and odd-even merge sort) and using both in tandem.

This repo contains the same exact examples from the rootbeer library repo, just filled either with comments, additions (and errors in them) to make sense of the logic behind it. Nothing else to see here folks.
